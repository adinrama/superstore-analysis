# Superstore Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the Superstore sales dataset to extract meaningful business insights and provide data-driven recommendations. The analysis focuses on four main objectives:

1. **Sales Trend Analysis** - Examining monthly sales patterns and identifying seasonal trends
2. **Product Performance Analysis** - Identifying top and bottom performing products and categories
3. **Shipping & Logistics Optimization** - Analyzing delivery efficiency across different shipping modes and regions
4. **Customer Segmentation** - Using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers

## Dataset

The analysis uses the Superstore dataset, a popular retail dataset containing information about:

- Sales and profits
- Product categories and sub-categories
- Customer segments
- Regional information
- Shipping details
- Order and shipping dates

## Analysis Workflow

The analysis follows these key steps:

1. **Data Loading** - Loading and initial examination of the dataset
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Cleaning data and creating derived features
3. **Univariate Analysis** - Analyzing distribution of individual variables
4. **Multivariate Analysis** - Examining relationships between variables
5. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Deep dive into the data to answer key business questions
6. **Results & Discussion** - Summarizing findings and drawing conclusions
7. **Recommendations** - Providing actionable business recommendations
